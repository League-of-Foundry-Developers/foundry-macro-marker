- Added MarkerCleaner class to help cleanup stray markers
- Added option to set an alternative icon for active macros

### Known issues
The examples won't work with The Furnace. `this` no longer references the macro itself when using that module.  
*The maintainer is aware of the issue and a fix is underway.*
